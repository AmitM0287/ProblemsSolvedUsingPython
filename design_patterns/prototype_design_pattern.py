    Prototype Design Pattern

    The Prototype design pattern is good for when creating new objects requires more resources than
    you want to use or have available. You can save resources by just creating a copy of any existing
    object that is already in memory.
    E.g., A file youâ€™ve downloaded from a server may be large, but since it is already in memory,
    you could just clone it, and work on the new copy independently of the original.
